## Introduction
A **UCSD** *BS Computer Science* transfer student aiming to specialize in the machine learning and artificial intelligence field. 

My academic interests beyond my field include data modeling and analysis, neuroanatomy with regards to cognitive science, and learning/decision making in the brain. My hobbies range from attempting to make my 3D printer work properly and casually raiding in Final Fantasy XIV.

## Significant Projects
### CRM (2020)
*repo is private because it was made for a personal client*

A basic Customer Resource Management web app made in React and hosted on Firebase Hosting with a database on Firestore.

### DejaVu (2018)
[repo](https://github.com/mlgi/DejaVu)

Following several guides and papers linked in the repo, this project implements the basic structure and function of an artificial neural network that using genetic algorithms to train, a personal endeavor I took during my time in community college.

> This project exists to document my creation some sort of neural network library from scratch. I am developing this in order to solidify my understanding of neural networks, not necessarily as a competitor to other existing machine learning libraries out there.

### FileCompression (2017)
*repo is private due to being class material*

This project was made to demonstrate understanding of the Huffman Encoding Tree to compress and decompress any binary file (with an unknown filesize restriction). The compiled binaries can be called with 
```
./compress <input_file> <output_file>
``` 
and
```
./decompress <compressed_file> <output_file>
```
